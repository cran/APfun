This package is intended to provide basic tools for the development of
higher level geo-processing functions. For instance, the `AProunder`
function is used to define the extent of tile schemes in the
[TileManager](https://github.com/andrew-plowright/TileManager) library,
or create summaries of tree stock in
[ForestTools](https://github.com/andrew-plowright/ForestTools).
